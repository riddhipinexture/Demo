https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-string-on-linux/

Contents of file1.txt : This line contains text.
Contents of file2.txt : You should learn Data Structures & Algorithms.

grep -l text file1.txt file2.txt
out: file1.txt

grep -l Text file1.txt file2.txt
out: 

grep -li Text file1.txt file2.txt // ignore case
out: file1.txt

grep -lir Text file1.txt file2.txt //directory
